-------
These instructions are for a manual installation using FTP, cPanel or other web hosting Control Panel.

1. Upload all of the files and folders to your server from the "Upload" folder, place them in your web root. The web root is different on some servers, cPanel it should be public_html/ and on Plesk it should be httpdocs/.

2. Rename config-dist.php to config.php and admin/config-dist.php to admin/config.php

3. For Linux/Unix make sure the following folders and files are writeable.

		chmod 0755 system/cache/

		chmod 0755 image/
		chmod 0755 image/cache/

Godaddy Issues

If your hosting on godaddy you might need to rename the php.ini to user.ini

It seems godadddy has started changing the industry standard names of files.
